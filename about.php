    <h1>About Me</h1>

    <h2>Who am I?</h2>

    <p>
      My name is Peter DeRuvo, and I've been a resident of Staten Island
      for most of my life. I was born in Grasmere and lived on the north
      shore until my family moved to Florida in 1998. Thankfully that
      didn't last long and by 2004 we were back in New York. I've been
      here ever since!

    <p>
      Now I live in West Brighton with my wife. I work in Manhattan as a
      concierge. Along the way I've devloped a huge passion for cooking
      and trying new foods. The best part about New York City is you never
      have to travel very far to find something new and exciting!

    <h2>Why did I make this site?</h2>

    <p>
      I created this site because I want to help Staten Islanders connect
      with each other via our shared culinary heritage. This Island is
      OBSESSED with food. I know there’s tons of great recipes out there
      hidden in cupboards, bookshelves, or grandmothers’ memories just
      waiting to be shared with the community. And maybe along with these
      recipes we can learn a little more about the neighborhoods and
      people that surround us.
